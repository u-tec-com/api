# Ultraloq API

The Ultraloq API connects Ultraloq system to 3rd IOT platform.

# Group A RESTful Service
The Ultraloq API is a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) service.

## Authentication
Nearly every request to the Ultraloq API requires an OAuth bearer token.

Exceptions to this rule will be documented.

## Content types
Nearly every request to the Ultraloq API should be expressed as JSON.

Nearly every response from the Ultraloq API will be expressed as JSON.

Exceptions to this rule will be documented.

## HTTP verbs
The Ultraloq API uses HTTP verbs in pretty standard ways:

- GET for retrieving information without side-effects
- PUT for updating existing resources, with partial-update semantics supported
- POST for creating new resources or blind upserts of existing resources
- DELETE for destructive operations on existing resurces

## Identifiers
All objects in the Ultraloq API can be identified by `object_type` and `object_id`. The `object_id` is a string and not globally unique, currently. That is there can be an `'object_type':'light_bulb'` and `'object_id':'abc'` and an `'object_type':'thermostat'` and `'object_id':'abc'`

It is possible for the API to re-assign identifiers to resources to rebalance keys; in this case, your resource will still exist but it (and all references to it) will be updated to the new identifier.  Your application should be able to handle this case.

## Creatable vs. permanent
The term "creatable" will describe a resource which may be created and/or destroyed by the user.

The term "permanent" will describe a resource which may not be directly created or deleted by a user.

Note that permanent **does not imply** that the resource will always exist, just that the user may not create or destroy it.  Under no circumstances should you assume that a resource will always exist.

## Mutable vs. immutable
The term "mutable" will describe a resource or attribute which the user may modify at will, assuming the user has the necessary permissions to do so.

The term "immutable" will describe a resouce or attribute which may not be modified directly by the user.

Note that immutable **does not imply** that the resource or attribute will never change, just that the user may not directly change it.  Under no circumstances should you assume that a resource or attribute will always remain the same.

## Error states
The common [HTTP Response Status Codes](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/status-codes.md) are used.

# Group OAuth
Authentication to the API

The Ultraloq API uses [OAuth2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).

Typically your application should use the OAuth2 authorization code grant.

Note that unlike most other calls, these calls do not require (and in fact should not use) an OAuth 2.0 bearer token.

## Authorization page [/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<client_id>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>&state=<state>]
### Obtain user authorization to use your application with their Ultraloq account [GET]

Please see the OAuth2 specification for more information about the use of authorization code grant and the state parameter.
Your application's redirect URIs should be registered with Ultraloq for the security of the user.
